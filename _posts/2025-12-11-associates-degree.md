I am thrilled to announce that today I officially completed my Associate of Arts in General Studies at the University of Massachusetts Global!

It has been a journey of hard work and organization, balancing my full-time leadership role at the Disney Store and my volunteer work. Maintaining a 3.5 GPA while working has been a challenge I am proud to have met.
